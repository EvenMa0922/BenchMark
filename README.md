# BenchMark

    This is my own benchmark program. Benchmark is a standard or point of reference against which things may be compared or assessed[1]. Users can run it on different machines to test their performance. Through the datas users can have visualized comparison of performance(like how fast of the CPU computes the certain operations)between different machines, or the comparison of performance of parallelism(multicores processing) on single machine.
